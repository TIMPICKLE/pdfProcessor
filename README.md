# pdfProcessor

## hi there, Recent work has been on PDF file processing, integrating various packages (pdF.js, PDF-lib, downlaod.js...). And write and copy various utility functions (arrayBufferToFile, checkFileType, ArrayBufferToBase64...) , familiar with a variety of commonly used interfaces (Canvas, blob...)

## After graduation, I just did some research on drawing canvas layer on PDF, and then I started to deal with PDF. Instead, do something meaningful.

## "The technology is open source, the business is proprietary."

## Abstract the code based on the existing business, package into a tool class, and then integrate some general PDF file processing functions, mainly for PDF to add digital signature this function service. Finally, package to NPM and open source to Github.
